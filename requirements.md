# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Project: Click Drift
## Type: Incremental Game

---

### üìå Overview

**Click Drift** is an incremental web-based clicker game where players generate resources by clicking a button that moves randomly across the screen. The game builds engagement through evolving mechanics such as multiple button types, upgrades, auto-clickers, and chaotic button behaviors. There is no prestige system; instead, long-term progression is embedded in the core gameplay via unlocks, traits, and variant stacking.

---

## üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop

1. Player clicks a **moving button** to earn Click Points (CP).
2. The button **teleports or moves** to a new location after each click.
3. Player spends CP on:
   - Upgrades
   - Auto-clickers
   - Unlocking new button types
4. Game becomes increasingly automated and chaotic.
